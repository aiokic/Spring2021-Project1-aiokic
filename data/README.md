# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the Presidential Elections in the US
I use 2020 Exploratory Testing Survey from ANES

original website to the data
https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2020-exploratory-testing-survey/

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.
